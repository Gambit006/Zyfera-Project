# Zyfera-Project


## 1- Planning 

I will start designing and choosing which technologies to use in the solution. I have limited time so ,it is the priority that learning cost is cheaper for me when I prefer programming language. 


## 2- Design 
Each part of the application will be created initially. I am going to develop using .NET ecosystem in this solution. 

### ToolsTools 
- c# 
- entity framework
- model first 
- mssql 
- fluent validation
- mapper 
- jwt token auth 
- swagger

It is expected that coding and testing will be completed in 3 hours according to expectation.
