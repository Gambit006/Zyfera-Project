# Zyfera-Project


## 1- Planning 

I will start designing and choosing which technologies to use in the solution. I have limited time so ,it is the priority that learning cost is cheaper for me when I prefer programming language. 


## 2- Design 
Each part of the application will be created initially. I am going to develop using .NET ecosystem in this solution. 

### Tools
- c# 
- entity framework
- model first 
- mssql 
- ~~fluent validation~~
- ~~mapper~~ 
- ~~jwt token auth~~ 
- swagger

It is expected that coding and testing will be completed in 3 hours according to expectation. 

## 3- Coding
When the application is coding, some of the tools were not used above because it is decided that these were not necessary. 


## 4- Test
The application was tested and the endpoint is working correctly. 
An unexpected error that is about migration was faced. So, the solution were codded more a hour compare to plan.
